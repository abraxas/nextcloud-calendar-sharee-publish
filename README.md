# nextcloud-calendar-sharee-publish

**Nextcloud Server** `35.0.0` - Nextcloud GmbH

CalDAV `PublishPlugin` only checks `{DAV:}write`. Owner-limit `limitAddressBookAndCalendarSharingToOwner` defaults to `no`. A colleague you gave **edit** on a calendar can publish it. Anyone with the secret URL reads your non-PRIVATE events with no login.

**A bad actor with edit on your calendar can turn it into a public URL. Anyone who has that URL can read your meetings and attendees without logging in.**

## What an attacker can do

You share a calendar with a colleague as **can edit**. That colleague posts `publish-calendar`. Nextcloud mints a public calendar URL.

Then:

- **Anyone with the URL** (no login) can **read your events**
- They see **titles, times, attendees** (non-`PRIVATE` objects)
- They cannot become you, and they cannot publish an address book this way
- A **view-only** sharee cannot do this; **edit** is enough

Reshare of the calendar is forbidden. Publish is not. The owner-limit config exists and is **off** by default.

---

## How I found it

`PublishPlugin` checks `{DAV:}write`, then `dav` / `limitAddressBookAndCalendarSharingToOwner`, which defaults to `no`. `Calendar::updateShares` forbids **reshare** when `isShared()`. Publish is a different verb. Write ACL still grants `{DAV:}write` to an edit-sharee.

I stood up official `nextcloud:35.0.0-apache`. Owner calendar `labcal` with a non-PRIVATE event SUMMARY `NEXTCLOUD-CAL-SHAREE-PUBLISH-WITNESS`.

First I sent `MKCALENDAR`. Sabre came back **405** `MethodNotAllowed`. I PUT the VEVENT anyway. **201**. The calendar was there. The collection-create verb was the wrong door, not the wrong house.

Shared read-write to `sharee`. Sharee POST `CS:publish-calendar` returned **202**. Unauth PROPFIND on the public URL contained the witness.

## The fix

Require the owner principal for publish, or default the owner-limit on **and** still deny publish for `isShared()` calendars. Reshare is already forbidden. Publish should follow it.
