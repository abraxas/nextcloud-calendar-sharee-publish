# Nextcloud unpublished #4 — write-sharee can publish the owner's calendar

CWE: CWE-284, CWE-862
Severity: High
Author: Abraxas Labs

## Description

`PublishPlugin` (CalDAV) only checks `{DAV:}write`, then `dav` / `limitAddressBookAndCalendarSharingToOwner` which defaults to `no`. A write-sharee (can edit) can POST `{http://calendarserver.org/ns/}publish-calendar` on the shared calendar. That inserts `ACCESS_PUBLIC` plus a 16-char `publicuri`. Unauthenticated PROPFIND/REPORT `/remote.php/dav/public-calendars/{token}` lists the owner's non-PRIVATE events. `Calendar::updateShares` forbids resharing when `isShared()`; publish is not gated.

## Product

Nextcloud Server 35.0.0 (`da02f41`). Lab oracle is `NEXTCLOUD-CAL-SHAREE-PUBLISH-WITNESS` in an unauthenticated public-calendar read, not a shell. CardDAV is out of scope.

## Isolation

Compose project `nextcloud-calendar-sharee-publish`. HTTP `127.0.0.1:18344`. Image `nextcloud:35.0.0-apache`. SQLite. Leave `limitAddressBookAndCalendarSharingToOwner` at default `no`. Sharee is a normal user, not instance admin. Share is read-write, not view-only.
